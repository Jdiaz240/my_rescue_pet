## Description
My Rescue Pet is an app designed to give pet owners as well as people looking to become a pet owner an online community.
My Rescue Pet provides our clients a single place where to search for pets to adopt and sometimes purchase,
nationally as well as in your local area. My Rescue Pet also gives pet owners with unexpected life situations the ability to re-home their pet and in some cases 
of a temporary emergency situation to request help made possible with the donations received through our donation portal. We provide our users with
information to help them locate their local pet rescue shelters.
My Rescue Pet also provides the users the ability to search and save different pets to compare before making the decision on their new family member.
